# **DoubleSlit MakeTemplates**
This repository includes Make template and include files for building C/C++
projects under Linux and Mac OS X. Libraries, archives, shared libraries
and executables can be **made** with the help of files in this repository.

Given that other higher-level repositories will always clamor for
documentation, it seems unlikely that I will document the structure of this
repository. Suffice it to write that **use** of this repository will be
documented in those higher-level repositories.
